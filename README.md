I'm not a Portuguese teacher. I'm writing it to help some friends learn Portuguese, and, as they say, you learn as you teach, so why not learn more about my own language?

## Alphabet <a id="Alphabet"></a>

It sounds silly to start from the alphabet, but just like it happens in english it will happen in portuguese. We speak different because we don't have the same sounds, and it is barely mentioned on the class room.
And not only that, the main point on learning the proper sounds of a language is that if we can't speak properly how will we understand when a native do.

> DON'T get me wrong, the term speak properly sounds pedantic, even more talking about a language spoken by 300 milion people around the world, but the mater of accents deserves its own big whole chapter 

While in english (just like in portuguese) there are 5 vowels, there are also around 20 (**twenty**)  sounds including short sounds, long sounds, and diphthongs. Well portuguese is a whole lot easier, we have the same 5 vowels but only 7 remarkable sounds and the diphthongs are made using the vowels we have.

### Sound translation Portuguese to English

| **é**              | [ɛ]              | /ɛ/                       | bed, said, fair, hair              |

| **ó**              | [ɔ]              | short sound like /ɔː/ (british english)   | thought, law, saw                  |
| **ô / o**          | [o]              | begin of the diphtong /oʊ/    | go, boat, no                       |

> **Note:** the english often uses diphtongs while portuguese uses short sounds. those examples users the short sound before it becomes another sound.

### Verbs<a id="Verbs"></a>
You will see verbs in the folowing main forms
 - Infinitivo/infinitive
 - Participio/past participle
 - Gerundio/ing form (do not confuse with gerund, that in english has a Different meaning of portuguese)
 - Flexionado/Inflected - that now, for the agility sake, we will focus on their verbal tenses

[Lern more](verbalinflections.md)

In portuguese there are 3 possible ends for the verbs, that are:
 1. *ar : Trabalh**ar**/to work, falar**ar**/to speak, estud**ar**/ to study
 1. *er : dev**er**/, Com**er**/to eat, beb*er*/to drink
 1. *ir : Part**ir**/to leave, Abr**ir**/to open, divid**ir**/to divide

These terminations will say the pattern to folow on the conjugation.
Most of people se the conjugation in portuguese as a monster, that is not ~~totally~~ true.

For the **regular** verbs, the conjugation is always the same.

you only need to replace the verb end for an easy pattern:

replace the verb end by each person termination.

But before we go for the examples, let's have a brief view on the **verbal tenses**

#### Verbal tenses

In portuguese there are 10 verbal tenses, but lets focus only 3 for now, lets first speak on the present (what are you doing this moment) on the past (what we did yesterday), and on the future (what you are going to do next).

E.g:

#### [Present]("" "Simple Present")

##### [Trabalhar]("" "To work")

 - **Eu** trabalh**o**
 - **você/ele/ela** Trabalh**a**
 
 - **Nós** trabalh**amos**
