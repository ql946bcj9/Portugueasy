## Alphabet <a id="Alphabet"></a>
It sounds silly to start from the alphabet, but just like it happens in englis it will happen in portuguese. We speak different because we don't have the same sounds;

While in english there are 5 vowels , just like in portuguese, there are also around 20 (**twenty**)  sounds including short sounds, long sounds, and diphthongs. Well portuguese is a whole lot easier, we have the same 5 vowels but only 7 remarkable sounds and the diphthongs are made usin the vowels we have.

In portuguese there are 3 possible ends for the verbs, that are:
 1. *ar : Trabalh**ar**/to work, falar**ar**/to speak, estud**ar**/ to study

These terminations will say the pattern to folow on the conjugation.
Most of people se the conjugation in portuguese as a monster, that is not ~~totally~~ true.

For the **regular** verbs, the conjugation is always the same.

you only need to replace the verb end for an easy pattern:

replace the verb end by each person termination.

But before we go for the examples, let's have a brief view on the **verbal tenses**

#### Verbal tenses

in portuguese there are 10 verbal tenses, but lets focus only 3, lets first speak on the past (what we did yesterday), on the present (what is blocking our task at this moment), and on the future (what you are going to do next).

E.g:

#### [Present]("" "Representação de materiais")
